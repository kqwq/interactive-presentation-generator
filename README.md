# interactive-presentation-generator

Create an interactive presentation using only HTML, JavaScript, and WebSocket!
This project allows a user to host an interactive presentation using HTML, JavaScript, and WebSocket. The user should configure the presentation by editing the `save/default.json` file. An annotated version can be found in `save/default_annotated.jsonc`.

If you have any questions, let me know on Discord (@kqwq) or open an issue on GitHub.
